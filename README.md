A machine learning project that classifies news articles into predefined categories (e.g., World, Sports, Business, Technology).
The pipeline includes data preprocessing, text vectorization (TF-IDF/word embeddings), model training using supervised learning algorithms,
and evaluation with accuracy and F1-score. This project demonstrates end-to-end NLP workflow for text classification
